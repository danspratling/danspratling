### Hi, I'm Dan üëã

I'm a frontend developer now running [Skyward Digital](https://skyward.digital).

I love working with Jamstack tech and, on occasion, creating new designs (when time allows). My real strength, though, is figuring out better ways and bridging gaps teams, customers, and everyone else. I'm a methodical, logical thinker and I'm constantly looking for force multiplier opportunities to help others provide their best results too.

I'm passionate about creating a better environment for everyone, and creating Skyward is a continuation of that goal. Better work environment, better client relations, better results.

When I'm not working, I'm probably exploring a fantasy or sci-fi world through games or movies, or trying out different kinds of food üçú

### What I'm Working on

Building up Skyward
- Improving the website
- Improving strategies within teams
- Writing blogs to share my experience & learnings

Client projects
- Client relations
- Managing & improving project workflow within the team
- And working on individual client work

Learning & Open source
- ...when I have time (as you can see, i'm pretty busy!). Currently, Astro

### Read my thoughts (and share yours)

I'm constantly writing as a way of helping expand my own knowledge. Transparency is one of my core values so I'm pretty open on what I talk about, from technology to strategy and money.

All my good stuff can currently be found on [Skyward's blog](https://skyward.digital/blog), or on [my newsletter](https://skyward.digital/newsletter)

### Ask me about

Say hi and ask me about anything

I'm especially enthusiastic about freelancing and business ownership, UX Design, Jamstack development & headless CMS', and nerding out over optimisations and improvements across all those areas.

### Want to work together?

I'm always open to opportunities, so if you have an idea you want to work together on, a client to recommend, or you want to chat with me on your blog or podcast then reach out!
